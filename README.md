# 🛒 Minimalist Online Shopping Core (C Project)

## 📌 Project Info
This is my **1st Year – 2nd Semester PSP (Problem Solving using Programming) [20ES104]** course project.  
Developed as part of the **C Programming curriculum**, it demonstrates fundamental programming concepts through a **console-based online shopping system**.

## 🎯 Project Title
**Minimalist Online Shopping Core**

## 📖 Project Description
The **Online Shopping System** is a **C-based console application** that simulates an e-commerce environment where users can:
- Browse product categories  
- Add items to a cart  
- Remove or update items  
- Generate the final bill with total cost  

The project showcases **functions, structures, arrays, and control statements** in C to create a practical shopping experience.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Implement a **menu-driven shopping system** using C.
- Demonstrate **file-free but structure-based cart management**.
- Provide functionalities for **adding, deleting, and modifying cart items**.
- Enable **automatic bill generation** with user details.

---

## 💡 Why Should We Use This?
✔️ **Practical Demonstration** – A real-life shopping model built purely in C.  
✔️ **Educational Value** – Helps beginners understand **structures, arrays, loops, and functions**.  
✔️ **Interactive** – Simple, menu-driven interface with multiple categories.  
✔️ **Extensible** – Can be enhanced with file handling or database connectivity later.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Dev C++** (IDE for running and debugging C code)  
- **Online C Compilers** (for testing portability)  

---

## ⚡ Models/Modules Implemented
The system is divided into **functions and modules**:
- **Product Display Functions**: `electronics()`, `books()`, `shoes()`, `fashions()`, `appliances()`, `furnitures()`, `grocceries()`, `beauty()`, `pharmacy()`, `sports()`  
- **Cart Management**: Adding, deleting (`delete_*()`), modifying (`change()`), viewing (`display*()`)  
- **Billing System**: `bill()` generates a detailed invoice with total cost  

📌 **Best Model Implemented** → **Billing Module (`bill()`)**  
Because it integrates all operations (selection, modification, and checkout) into a real-world-like transaction system, making the project complete and practical.

---

## 📊 Results
✔️ Items can be browsed by category  
✔️ Users can add, delete, and update cart items  
✔️ Final bill is generated with total cost and details  
✔️ User details (name, phone number, address) included in invoice
